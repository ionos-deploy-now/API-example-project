# Example Project to Get Started with APIs

If you're a beginner developer, you may have heard of APIs, but you may want some clarification on what they are and how to use them. This example project showcases how an API can be embedded into a simple website to represent retrieved information. This website displays jokes from the [Chuck Norris Facts API](https://api.chucknorris.io/). You can [view a demo here](https://docs.ionos.space/blog/api-guide).

We've created an article that explains the concept of APIs in detail and explains how this example project works. [Read "A Beginner Developer's Guide to APIs"](https://docs.ionos.space/blog/api-guide).
